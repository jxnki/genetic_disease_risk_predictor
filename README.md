Project Description
**InheritX** is a probabilistic genetic modeling engine that democratizes access to risk assessment for hereditary disorders like Thalassemia and Hemophilia.
By combining **Bayesian inference** with **Hardy-Weinberg population statistics** and **Graph Theory**, it analyzes family history, consanguinity, and ethnic background to provide accurate, 
accessible pre-screening for high-risk, underserved populations.

The Concept
Core Idea: InheritX is like a smart genetic weather forecast. Just as a weather app tells you the chance of rain, 
our tool calculates the precise mathematical probability of couples passing on "silent" genetic diseases (like Thalassemia) to their future children.

Main Objective: To provide a free, scientifically accurate pre-screening for couples who cannot afford expensive genetic counselors. 
We want to identify "silent carriers"—healthy people who carry a hidden risk—so families can make informed decisions before conception.

Mathematical Concepts Used
1. Mendelian Inheritance (The Logic): Uses the classic "genetic coin toss" rules to calculate the exact probability (e.g., 25%) of a child inheriting a recessive trait from carrier parents.
2. Hardy-Weinberg Principle (The Baseline): Uses the equation $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$ to mathematically derive hidden carrier rates from disease statistics, ensuring accurate baselines for different ethnic groups.
3. Graph Theory (The Map): Models the family tree as a network of nodes and edges, tracing the path of a gene from grandparents to parents to identify risks from relatedness.
4. Bayesian Probability (The Detective): Updates the risk score dynamically by treating vague clues (like "suspected" symptoms or sibling history) as mathematical evidence.
5. Monte Carlo Simulation (The Proof): Validates the prediction by virtually simulating 10,000 births in milliseconds, proving the theoretical risk matches statistical reality.
